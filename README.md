# Dredge Rare Fish Restock
Makes the fish from the Recording Rarities pursuit replenish themselves just like every other fish.

The fish from that pursuit are the Oarfish, Gulper Eel, Goliath Tigerfish, and Coelacanth.

There are a few other places that don't restock, but the Recording Rarities fish are the only one-time fish because they don't have another restocking fishing spot anywhere else

There are a ton of unrestocking spots for the Red Snapper.
The only other spots are a Ghost Shark and Barreleye (each only having one unrestockable spot)

According to one of the devs these other spots are actually bugs (I guess I found a bug)

- Barreleye spot is in between twisted strand and stellar basin (E7).
- Ghost Shark spot is by Old Fortress (B6).

Another thing this mod does is restock a bunch of dredge spots.
