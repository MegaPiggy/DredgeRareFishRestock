# Dredge Rare Fish Restock
Makes the fish from the Recording Rarities pursuit replenish themselves just like every other fish.

The fish from that pursuit are the Oarfish, Gulper Eel, Goliath Tigerfish, and Coelacanth. As well as the Sleeper Shark from Pale Reach DLC.

Another thing this mod does is restock a bunch of one-time dredge spots. (rings, earrings, etc)

This should work on any new fish added in newer update because it searches for only one-time only fishing spots.

In past updates there used to be one Ghost Shark unrestocking spot, and one Barreleye unrestocking spot, and a ton of unrestocking spots for the Red Snapper. 
According to one of the devs, these other spots were actually bugs (I guess I found a bug)
